          <p class="card-text"><small class="text-muted">My name is Patrick D. Scott a long term offender who served 31 years of incarceration. On April 18, 2020 I was released to parole supervision. I participated in multiple educational, self-help and job skill programs during my time in prison. Those programs aided me in decision making and positive critical thinking, I received plenty of 
            support from my wife helping me to be re-acclimated into society. Soon after my release into the community I immediately began to put into motion a plan that I dreamed and designed before I was granted parole. D.O.R.T, H.Y. (Defenders of Real Truth Helping Youth).
            
            It took me less than thirty days to find full-time employment with the United Parcel Service in Oakland, Ca. I remain gainfully employed there in the present day. I was determined to become a provider for my household, but more than that I was determined to become a source of inspiration for others. Most of my inspiration comes from my hardships, turmoil, personal struggles, and grief. With that inspiration I created D.O.R.T.H.Y The goal is to bring about a positive change building a support network through unity and investing towards a common cause to reach, teach, and speak to youth offenders or for anyone else who cares to listen.
            When I'm not working at UPS I'm busy spreading positive messages to the community.
